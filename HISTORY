VDR Plugin 'remotetimers' Revision History
------------------------------------------

2012-06-27: Version 1.0.0

- Updated the menu parts copied from VDR to 2.0.2
- Added service call to open schedule or timers menu
- Updated Makefile for VDR 1.7.36 and dropped compatibility with older VDR
  versions
- Updated the menu parts copied from VDR to 2.0.1
- Updated Slovak translations (thanks to Milan Hrala)
- Included a copy of svdrpservice.h
- Updated skin LCARS patch for 1.7.29 and above
- New setup options to control if the plugin's schedule, timers and recordings
  menus should indicate the correct menu category (since VDR 1.7.28) and call
  SetItemEvent/Timer/Recording (since VDR 1.7.34). Some skins will then use
  their own way to display the item. However the skin is not aware of multiuser
  or local and remote timers. So it will display all items the same way (thanks
  to seahawk1986@vdrportal for tuning and debugging this for skinnopacity).
- Set menu category of main menu to mcMain (thanks to seahawk1986@vdrportal)
- Updated the menu parts copied from VDR to 1.7.35 including support for
  sorting recordings with VDR 1.7.29 and above.

2012-06-27: Version 0.1.7

- If server recordings are mounted in a subdirectory of local video dir,
  make server and other clients aware of changes made by this client.
- Fixed occasionally missed video directory mounts during startup. Now getting
  mtime and device id of .update file already in SetupParse(), i.e. before VDR
  starts to scan recordings.
- Updated Slovak translations (thanks to Milan Hrala)
- Added vdr-1.7.28-skinlcars.patch to display remote timers in skin LCARS'
  main menu view
- Fixed RemoteTimers::ForEach service call
- With 1.7.28 or newer, show remaining disk space in minutes based on size and
  length of currently selected recording in menus "Recording info" and "Edit
  recording".
- With 1.7.28 or newer, calculate remaining disk space in minutes based on
  size and length of all recordings on current filesystem.
- Updated Italian translations (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Updated the menu parts copied from VDR to 1.7.28
- New option to map channels by number instead of channel id when syncing
  between client and server. Useful if you want to view and record different
  variants of a simulcast channel on client and server (e.g. HD/SD or DVB-T/
  DVB-S). Requires channels to be in same order (suggested by woz@vdrportal)
- API changes of VDR 1.7.28
- Updated MainMenuHooks patch (thanks to Manuel Reimer)
- Fixed compile error due to unknown type 'tI18nPhrase'
- Released recordings must be re-read or they reappear in recordings menu

2011-10-05: Version 0.1.6

- Adapted handler of SVDRP command LSTR to VDR 1.7.21+ format, including
  the recording's length.
- Updated the menu parts copied from VDR to 1.7.21
- README now mentions the new VDR default port.
- Fixed RecordingInfo update for TS recordings. The altered lines were
  appended but re-writing a clean version of the info file failed. So the
  recording in the menu was not updated, instead an error message appeared.
- Adapted to API change of VDR 1.7.21 (access recording priority/lifetime)
- Fixed crash when moving a local timer to the server

2011-04-18: Version 0.1.5

- Fixed wrong help keys in recordings menu when user filter is active

  be a private member in VDR 1.7.18

2011-03-01: Version 0.1.4

- Improved German translations
- Updated Italian translations (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Default server port is now 0, i.e. taken from svdrpservice
- Fixed missing timer markers when opening the Schedule for the first time
- Implemented moving recording to a different filesystem with optional
  bandwidth throttle
- Cutting from menu failed for PES recordings since VDR 1.7.3 due to missing
  parameters to cMarks::Load
- Moving recordings into folders named ' ' failed or caused unexpected
  results as VDR's text input control strips trailing whitespace. Now
  folder ' ' is assumed when renaming a recording and the name ends with
  the folder delimiter character
- Don't rename a recording if the user completely wiped out the name
- Added service interface for operating on timers
