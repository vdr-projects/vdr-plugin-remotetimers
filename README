!!!!  WARNING !!!!
------------------
Version 0.1.x is a development release. The core functionality should be
fine, but some of the new features are either incomplete or not very well
tested. See "Major open issues" at the end of this README.

1. Description:
---------------
With the remotetimers plugin you can add/edit/remove timers on both, the
local (client) VDR and a remote (server) VDR. You can even move timers
between both VDRs. The plugin has its own implementations of the Schedule,
Timer and Recordings menus. All of them are feature extended copies of VDR's
original menus, adding e.g. multiuser support.

2. Requirements:
----------------
- plugin svdrpservice (available via http://vdr.schmirler.de)

3. Installation:
----------------
Straightforward:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/src
- tar xzf vdr-remotetimers-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf remotetimers-<VERSION> remotetimers

If you didn't do that already (otherwise svdrpservice.h is missing):
- tar xzf vdr-svdrpservice-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf svdrpservice-<VERSION> svdrpservice

3.1. Applying patches:
----------------------
In the patches directory of the remotetimers source distribution you will
find two patches for VDR. Both are optional, i.e. remotetimers will work
just fine without them, but add support for some additional features:

- MainMenuHooks: replace the VDR menus "Schedule", "Timers" and "Recordings"
  with the corresponding plugin menus.
- remote_instant_recordings: redirects instant recordings to the server VDR

A detailed description of the patches and instructions how to apply them can
be found in the patch files.

Note that the remotetimers plugin checks VDR for the presence of these
patches at compile time. So don't forget to (re-)compile VDR and
remotetimers *after* patching VDR.

3.2. Deployment:
----------------
When done, compile and install remotetimers (and svdrpservice) as usual.
Then add both plugins to the script starting your VDR (e.g. runvdr). No
options required, so simply append:

  -P remotetimers -P svdrpservice

Since svdrpservice-0.0.4 you can already specify the server IP on the
commandline. It will then server as the default IP for all plugins using
svdrpservice:

  -P remotetimers -P 'svdrpservice 192.0.2.1'

Finally check the file svdrphosts.conf on the remote VDR: The IP of the VDR
running remotetimers must be listed or otherwise the connection will be
refused.

4. Setup options:
-----------------
Before you can connect, your local VDR must know the IP address of the
remote VDR. Either configure a default IP in the svdrpservice plugin or
enter it in remotetimers' setup.

The plugin setup offers the following options:

- Server IP
IP address of SVDRP server. Leave empty or enter "0.0.0.0" if you want
to use the default IP configured in the svdrpservice plugin.

- Server port
SVDRP port on server (usually 2001). Enter "0" if you want to use the
default port from svdrpservice.

- Hide mainmenu entry
Should be obvious ;-)

- Replace mainmenu "Schedule"
When enabled, each call to the local VDR Schedule menu will give you
the remotetimers Schedule menu instead. Only available if MainMenuHooks
patch has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- Replace mainmenu "Timers"
Dito for Timers menu.

- Replace mainmenu "Recordings"
Dito for Recordings menu.

*** Defaults for new timers ***

- Location
Determines if by default new timers will be created on the local or on
the remote VDR.

- Instant recordings
Determines if an instant recording should be handled by the local or by
the remote VDR. Only available if the remote_instant_recordings patch
has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- Pause recordings
Dito for paused live view. Note that when pausing live TV, VDR immediately
starts to replay the new recording. If handled remotely, the local VDR
must know where the recording will appear. Replay will fail if you don't
point remotetimers to the correct remote recordings directory (see below).

- User ID
Select the user IDs new timers should get by default. Use the special
value "0" to indicate a timer which is always visible, i.e. belongs to
everyone. If you select "Resume ID", remotetimers will assign the ID of
the user who is current at the moment the timer is created.

*** Settings for menu ***

- Binding of Ok/Blue keys in "What's on" menus
Vanilla VDR shows the EPG details with "Ok" and switches to the selected
channel with "Blue". Swap it if you like.

- Show progress bar in menu "Schedule"
Adds progress bars to the "What's on now?" menu.

- User ID filter in menu "Schedule"
If set to "0", all timers will be shown. Private timers (as opposed to
timers of user "0") are indicated with the character "P". If set to a
specific ID, only timers of user "0" and the selected ID will be marked.
Select "Resume ID" to filter by the current user.

- User ID filter in menu "Timers"
If set to "0", all timers will be listed. When set to a specific ID, only
timers of this specific user and timers of user "0" will be visible. Select
"Resume ID" to filter by the current user.

- User ID filter in menu "Recordings"
Dito for recordings. A recording inherits the user IDs of the timer.

*** Remote recordings ***

- Mounted on subdirectory
Enter the name of the server's recordings directory relativ to the local
video directory. If e.g. your local video directory is "/video/" and
"/video/server/" is the mountpoint for the server's recordings, enter
"server". Leave empty, if the local video directory *is* the mounted server
directory. Remote cutting and remotely recording paused live view won't
work as expected when this setting is incorrect.

- Monitor update file
If the server's recordings directory is mounted on a subdirectory of the
local recordings directory, the local VDR won't detect updates such as
new or deleted recordings made by the remote VDR. Likewise, VDR will miss a
mount or unmount if the local video directory itself is server mounted and
the timestamp of the update file is older afterwards. Enable this options to
have remotetimers monitor the .update file and refresh the local recordings
list when necessary.

5. Usage:
---------
The remotetimers menus are more or less a copy of the original VDR
menus. So it should be quite clear how things work.

5.1. Going multiuser:
---------------------
One major different is the multiuser support. Timers and the resulting
recordings may be associated with one or multiple user IDs. It is then
possible to filter lists by user.

The special user ID "0" corresponds to a conventional VDR timer/recording.
It is always visible and can be deleted by anyone. Likewise, when the
filter of a menu is set to user ID "0", no filtering will apply. All
entries are visible and may be deleted. Nothing new so far.

The user IDs "1" through "9" are used to identify individual users. It is
possible to assign multiple IDs to a timer/recording. If e.g. users "1" and
"3" are interested in viewing a recording, both set their ID on it (or
rather on the corrensponding timer). Now the menu's filter come into play.
You can filter the items by one ID. When filtering by ID "2", the recording/
timer of users "1" and "3" will be hidden. Change the filter to ID "1" and
the recording/timer will pop up again. Note that the yellow button is not
labeled "Delete", as when user "1" pushes it, the timer/recording won't be
deleted. Instead it will just remove ID "1" from it. I decided to not ask
for confirmation, it only alerts you when really deleting an object. Now
let's switch the filter to user "3". As expected, the timer/recording is
still there. This time the yellow button is "Delete", as user "3" is the
only remaining owner.

"How do I actually switch users?", I hear you ask. Well, in the Timers and
Recordings list, just press the number key. It is not possible to switch
users while in the Schedule menu. If a filter applies (i.e. filter is not
set to user "0"), the current user ID is displayed in the menu's title bar.

Now what about all the setup options related to the user ID? You have to
make a decision here. On a VDR commonly used by one individual user, it's
obvious. Simply configure the user's ID everywhere (also as VDR's "Resume
ID" - see below). If multiple users share the same VDR, there are two
possibilities: keep user state or not.

The latter means that VDR will forget about the current user everytime you
enter the menu. The filter is always reset to the value specified in the
plugin setup (User ID filter in menu "..."). Most likely you will turn of
filtering by default (i.e. user "0"). For the default user ID of new timers,
"0" or all user IDs would be a good choice in this case.

If in contrast you want VDR to remember you, select "Resume ID" as user ID
filter. A change of the current user is then saved to VDR's setup variable
"Resume ID". Never heard of this option? It's in VDR's "Replay" setup menu.
VDR keeps a resume file with every recording. If it is missing, the
recording is new. Otherwise it contains the position where playback has
been stopped. The default value for "Resume ID" is 0. If you change it to a
different value, you get an additional, independant resume file. So with
"Resume ID" backed filtering in remotetimers you will automatically yield
individual resume status files. The default user ID of new timers can also
be set to "Resume ID". How to actually select the value "Resume ID" in the
setup might not be obvious: It corresponds to the value "-1", therefore you
can select it by pressing "left" until "Resume ID" shows up.

5.2. Schedule menu:
-------------------
In the setup you can enable progress bars for the "What's on now?" menu.
Private timers are indicated by a "P" as oposed to the standard "T"
character. Private timers of other users can be filtered out.

5.3. Timers menu:
-----------------
Looks almost like VDR's original timers menu. A letter in front of the
channel number indicates if this entry refers to a local or a remote
timer. Hit the number keys to change the current user ID filter. With
"0" all timers will be listed. Otherwise the menu title will show you
which user ID filter currently applies.

When editing a timer two additional menu items will show up: The location
of the timer (local or remote) and the user IDs it belongs to. Changing
the location moves the timer from the local to the remote VDR or vice versa.
Note that you cannot move a running timer. It has to be stopped first.

5.4. Recordings menu:
---------------------
As in the timers menu, hit the number keys to change the user ID filter.
The "red" button will neither start to replay a recording nor will it open
the recording commands menu. Instead it allows you to edit the recording.
You can change the priority, livetime, user IDs and the name. "Red" gives
you the recording commands, "green" starts the cutter on the recording. For
a network mounted recording, the cutter is started on the remote VDR.

6. Major open issues:
---------------------
- Editing recordings on a VDR with multiple video directories has not been
  tested at all. Beware! You might loose your data!
- Renaming recordings across filesystems not implemented
- remote_instant_recordings patch not tested with timersync-plugin

7. Credits:
-----------
Thanks to Klaus Schmidinger and everyone who contributed to those parts
of the menu code I copied from VDR.
