1. Description:
---------------
With the remotetimers plugin you can add/edit/remove timers on both, the
local (client) VDR and a remote (server) VDR. You can even move timers
between both VDRs. The plugin has its own implementations of the Schedule,
Timer and Recordings menus. All of them are feature extended copies of VDR's
original menus, adding e.g. multiuser support.

2. Requirements:
----------------
- plugin svdrpservice (available via http://vdr.schmirler.de)

3. Installation:
----------------
Straightforward:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/src
- tar xzf vdr-remotetimers-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf remotetimers-<VERSION> remotetimers

If you didn't do that already:
- tar xzf vdr-svdrpservice-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf svdrpservice-<VERSION> svdrpservice

3.1. Applying patches:
----------------------
In the patches directory of the remotetimers source distribution you will
find some patches for VDR. They are all optional, i.e. remotetimers will
work just fine without them, but add support for some additional features:

- MainMenuHooks: replace the VDR menus "Schedule", "Timers" and "Recordings"
  with the corresponding plugin menus.
- remote_instant_recordings: redirects instant recordings to the server VDR
- skinlcars: show remote timers in mainmenu

A detailed description of the patches and instructions how to apply them can
be found in the patch files.

Note that the remotetimers plugin checks VDR for the presence of these
patches at compile time. So don't forget to (re-)compile VDR and
remotetimers *after* patching VDR.

3.2. Deployment:
----------------
When done, compile and install remotetimers (and svdrpservice) as usual.
Then add both plugins to the script starting your VDR (e.g. runvdr). No
options required, so simply append:

  -P remotetimers -P svdrpservice

Since svdrpservice-0.0.4 you can already specify the server IP and port
on the commandline. It will then serve as the default for all plugins
using svdrpservice:

  -P remotetimers -P 'svdrpservice 192.0.2.1:6419'

Finally check the file svdrphosts.conf on the remote VDR: The IP of the VDR
running remotetimers must be listed or otherwise the connection will be
refused.

4. Setup options:
-----------------
Before you can connect, your local VDR must know the IP address of the
remote VDR. Either configure a default IP in the svdrpservice plugin or
enter it in remotetimers' setup.

The plugin setup offers the following options:

- Server IP
IP address of SVDRP server. Leave empty or enter "0.0.0.0" if you want
to use the default IP configured in the svdrpservice plugin.

- Server port
SVDRP port on server. Since VDR 1.7.15 the default port is 6419, before
it was 2001. The special value 0 uses the default port configured in
svdrpservice.

- Map channels using
The default is "channel ID" and this should not be changed unless you are
absolutely sure that you know what you are doing. Channels are identified
using a unique ID. A certain channel may have different channel number on
client and server. But what if you want to view and record different
variants of a simulcast channel on client and server?
* You prefer watching live TV in HD but want to record in SD
* You have one client which can't do HD but want to record everything in HD
* Your client uses a local DVB-T card for live TV, the server has DVB-S
When you select "channel number", timers will stick to the same channel
number, no matter if it actually belongs to the same channel or not. So
it's probably a good idea to keep channels in the same order on client
and server. Just swap the positions of the HD/SD channels or use the
same channel numbers for corresponding DVB-T/DVB-S channels.

- Hide mainmenu entry
Should be obvious ;-)

*** Defaults for new timers ***

- Location
Determines if by default new timers will be created on the local or on
the remote VDR.

- Instant recordings
Determines if an instant recording should be handled by the local or by
the remote VDR. Only available if the remote_instant_recordings patch
has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- Pause recordings
Dito for paused live view. Note that when pausing live TV, VDR immediately
starts to replay the new recording. If handled remotely, the local VDR
must know where the recording will appear. Replay will fail if you don't
point remotetimers to the correct remote recordings directory (see below).

- User ID
Select the user IDs new timers should get by default. Use the special
value "0" to indicate a timer which is always visible, i.e. belongs to
everyone. If you select "Resume ID", remotetimers will assign the ID of
the user who is current at the moment the timer is created.

*** Settings for menu "Schedule" ***

- Replace mainmenu
When enabled, each call to the local VDR Schedule menu will give you
the remotetimers Schedule menu instead. Only available if MainMenuHooks
patch has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- List style
Some skins display events in a more sophisticated way. With the default
"Plugin" you will get a simple list. Select "Skin" if you want the skin
to draw the list. The downside is that skins are not aware of multiuser,
so it will display events with normal and private timers the same way
(see "User ID filter" below).

- Show progress bar in menu "Schedule"
Adds progress bars to the "What's on now?" menu.

- What's on at ...? 1-4
You can define up to 4 custom times which will show up in the "Schedule"
menu in addition to "Now" and "Next". Hit the "Green" button in the
"Schedule" menu multiple times to cycle through all views. The special
value 00:00 disables the custom times. Use 00:01 or 23:59 to get the
EPG for around midnight.

- Key binding of Ok/Blue
Vanilla VDR shows the EPG details with "Ok" and switches to the selected
channel with "Blue". Swap it if you like.

- User ID filter
If set to "0", all timers will be shown. Private timers (as opposed to
timers of user "0") are indicated with the character "P". If set to a
specific ID, only timers of user "0" and the selected ID will be marked.
Select "Resume ID" to filter by the current user.

*** Settings for menu "Timers" ***

- Replace mainmenu
When enabled, each call to the local VDR Timers menu will give you
the remotetimers Timers menu instead. Only available if MainMenuHooks
patch has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- List style
Some skins display timers in a more sophisticated way. With the default
"Plugin" you will get a simple list. Select "Skin" if you want the skin
to draw the list. The downside is that skins will display local and
remote timers the same way.

- User ID filter
If set to "0", all timers will be listed. When set to a specific ID, only
timers of this specific user and timers of user "0" will be visible. Select
"Resume ID" to filter by the current user.

*** Settings for menu "Recordings" ***

- Replace mainmenu
When enabled, each call to the local VDR Recordings menu will give you
the remotetimers Recordings menu instead. Only available if MainMenuHooks
patch has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- List style
Some skins display recordings in a more sophisticated way. With the
default "Plugin" you will get a simple list. Select "Skin" if you want
the skin to draw the list. With some skins you will get two free disk
space indications in the title bar. Remotetimers shows it for the
current partition, VDR for the main video directory.

- User ID filter
If set to "0", all recordings will be listed. When set to a specific ID,
only recordings of this specific user and recordings of user "0" will be
visible. Select "Resume ID" to filter by the current user. A recording
inherits the user IDs of the timer.

- Move recording bandwidth limit (Mbit/s)
If you rename a recording and the new name points to a different filesystem,
the recording must be copied in the background. If you want to limit the
bandwidth used for transfer, you can do it here.

*** Remote recordings ***

- Mounted on subdirectory
Enter the name of the server's recordings directory relativ to the local
video directory. If e.g. your local video directory is "/video/" and
"/video/server/" is the mountpoint for the server's recordings, enter
"server". Leave empty, if the local video directory *is* the mounted server
directory. Remote cutting and remotely recording paused live view won't
work as expected when this setting is incorrect.

- Monitor update file
If the server's recordings directory is mounted on a subdirectory of the
local recordings directory, the local VDR won't detect updates such as
new or deleted recordings made by the remote VDR. Likewise, VDR will miss a
mount or unmount if the local video directory itself is server mounted and
the timestamp of the update file is older afterwards. Enable this options to
have remotetimers monitor the .update file and refresh the local recordings
list when necessary.

5. Usage:
---------
The remotetimers menus are more or less a copy of the original VDR
menus. So it should be quite clear how things work.

5.1. Going multiuser:
---------------------
One major different is the multiuser support. Timers and the resulting
recordings may be associated with one or multiple user IDs. It is then
possible to filter lists by user.

The special user ID "0" corresponds to a conventional VDR timer/recording.
It is always visible and can be deleted by anyone. Likewise, when the
filter of a menu is set to user ID "0", no filtering will apply. All
entries are visible and may be deleted. Nothing new so far.

The user IDs "1" through "9" are used to identify individual users. It is
possible to assign multiple IDs to a timer/recording. If e.g. users "1" and
"3" are interested in viewing a recording, both set their ID on it (or
rather on the corrensponding timer). Now the menu's filter come into play.
You can filter the items by one ID. When filtering by ID "2", the recording/
timer of users "1" and "3" will be hidden. Change the filter to ID "1" and
the recording/timer will pop up again. Note that the yellow button is not
labeled "Delete", as when user "1" pushes it, the timer/recording won't be
deleted. Instead it will just remove ID "1" from it. I decided to not ask
for confirmation, it only alerts you when really deleting an object. Now
let's switch the filter to user "3". As expected, the timer/recording is
still there. This time the yellow button is "Delete", as user "3" is the
only remaining owner.

"How do I actually switch users?", I hear you ask. Well, in the Timers and
Recordings list, just press the number key. It is not possible to switch
users while in the Schedule menu. If a filter applies (i.e. filter is not
set to user "0"), the current user ID is displayed in the menu's title bar.

Now what about all the setup options related to the user ID? You have to
make a decision here. On a VDR commonly used by one individual user, it's
obvious. Simply configure the user's ID everywhere (also as VDR's "Resume
ID" - see below). If multiple users share the same VDR, there are two
possibilities: keep user state or not.

The latter means that VDR will forget about the current user everytime you
enter the menu. The filter is always reset to the value specified in the
plugin setup (User ID filter in menu "..."). Most likely you will turn off
filtering by default (i.e. user "0"). For the default user ID of new timers,
"0" or all user IDs would be a good choice in this case.

If in contrast you want VDR to remember you, select "Resume ID" as user ID
filter. A change of the current user is then saved to VDR's setup variable
"Resume ID". Never heard of this option? It's in VDR's "Replay" setup menu.
VDR keeps a resume file with every recording. If it is missing, the
recording is new. Otherwise it contains the position where playback has
been stopped. The default value for "Resume ID" is 0. If you change it to a
different value, you get an additional, independant resume file. So with
"Resume ID" backed filtering in remotetimers you will automatically yield
individual resume status files. The default user ID of new timers can also
be set to "Resume ID". How to actually select the value "Resume ID" in the
setup might not be obvious: It corresponds to the value "-1", therefore you
can select it by pressing "left" until "Resume ID" shows up.

5.2. Schedule menu:
-------------------
In the setup you can enable progress bars for the "What's on now?" menu.
Private timers are indicated by a "P" as oposed to the standard "T"
character. Private timers of other users can be filtered out.

5.3. Timers menu:
-----------------
Looks almost like VDR's original timers menu. A letter in front of the
channel number indicates if this entry refers to a local or a remote
timer. Hit the number keys to change the current user ID filter. With
"0" all timers will be listed. Otherwise the menu title will show you
which user ID filter currently applies.

When editing a timer two additional menu items will show up: The location
of the timer (local or remote) and the user IDs it belongs to. Changing
the location moves the timer from the local to the remote VDR or vice versa.
Note that you cannot move a running timer. It has to be stopped first. With
"Red" you can select a folder for the recording.

If a "%" is shown as the second character in the timer list, there's a timer
conflict. Edit the timer to see the conflicting timers. The conflict check
relies on the epgsearch plugin. It must be installed on the server to report
remote timer conflicts and it must be installed on the client to report local
timer conflicts.

5.4. Recordings menu:
---------------------
As in the timers menu, hit the number keys to change the user ID filter.
In VDR you can change the sort order of recordings with "0". In remotetimers
hit the current user ID.

The "red" button will neither start to replay a recording nor will it open
the recording commands menu. Instead it allows you to edit the recording.
You can change the priority, lifetime, user IDs and the name. "Red" lets
you change the folder, "green" starts the cutter on the recording and
"Yellow" gives you the recording commands. For a network mounted recording,
the cutter is started on the remote VDR.

You can rename a recording or move it into a different folder, too. If the
destination folder is on a different filesystem, remotetimers will ask you
if it should move the recording in the background. The bandwidth for this
background activity can be limited in the plugin setup. It is possible to
abort the task in the plugin main menu (make sure it isn't hidden).

In contrast to VDR's original recordings menu, the disk space information
in the title bar always corresponds to the filesystem of the currently
selected directory. So if there are subdirectories in your video directory
which live on a different partition or on a network share, the disk space
information changes when descending into this directory.

The titles of the "Recording info" and "Edit recording" menus include
the recording's size and length. It will also display the remaining disk
space in minutes based on size and length of the currently selected
recording.

of the menu code I copied from VDR.
